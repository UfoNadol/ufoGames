# ufoGames
Hello, I'm Ufo Blorg.

In this repo you will find games that I wrote.
For now most of the content was inspired with tutorials.
-Game Doom Tac Toe is just simple alternative for Tic Tac Toe (circle and cross)
To develop this game I used C++ builder 6 by Borland which is free to use since borland changed name.
Borlands C++ builder is RAD software (rapid application development).
